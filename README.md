# Advanced Excel VBA Scripting 

This repository uses the scripting language of Microsoft Office projects, VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) scripting. Using this language I uesd a given dataset of stock market data to organize information on each Ticker then wrote programs to calculate the Total change in stock value, percentage change, the average daily change, and stock volume. And used conditional programming to heighlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
Included two rows over was an added column with additional scripting to isolate the stock with the gratest volume, greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and the greatest average change.
