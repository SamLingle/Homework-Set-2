# Advanced Excel VBA Scripting 

## Objective
This repository is meant to showcase VBA [(Visual Basic for Applications)](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/vba/) scripting. the scripting language of Microsoft Office projects. Using this language opens up quicker, more robust ways of cleaning and restructuring data in Excel sheets. And is very useful for automating tedious data munging jobs. 
Here I used a given dataset of stock market data from a three year period to organize information on each Ticker then wrote programs to calculate:
  * Total change in stock value
  * Percentage change in value 
  * Average daily change 
  * Stock volume. 
  * And used conditional programming to highlight positive value change in green and negative in red.
  
Included two rows over was an added column with additional scripting to isolate the stock with the gratest volume, greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and the greatest average change.
